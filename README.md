# gerenciador-calendar
Script to create many events and send them to google calendar with a certain color according to the "theme" that is defined by the summary name

Library versions:
DateTime==5.0

pytz==2022.7.1

Could'nt find 'os' version


Every other information is avaible in google api guides:

quickstart guide:

event creation guide:
https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/create-events?hl=pt-br

What to do next:

*Re-do the login that is poorly made and unreadeble.

*That the theme information and already used collors and names get saved somewhere to avoid repetitions

*In future integrate this on a organization software, maybe a UI? I usually hate all organization softwares cause they don't take in count that TDAH peoples exist,
maybe an organization software that re-make your planning with the inputs that you give without the 'OMG i didnt do anything this week and have to re-do all my planning
and chaos and i hate myself'
